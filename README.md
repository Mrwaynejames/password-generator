# password-generator

## Description

This site was created in order to help users come up with a password. Today so many sites require so much secuirty that your password you have used forever no longer work. This application allows users to accept what criteria they want and choose a password length and it will generate it for them. Takin gout the stress of making sure what you came up with in youe head wil work.

During this process I learned not just how delicate coding is but how cruicial order is. When I would group elements based on password criteria parts of the site wouldnt work. When I would organise it by what kind of element then everything woudl work. Building out a site required me to stay very organise as there are a lot of variables that you will associate to many parts.
